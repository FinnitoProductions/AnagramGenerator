# AnagramGenerator
Code for the anagrams project in my expert systems class.

Generates and prints all anagrams for a given word with length not exceeding system capacity, using JESS' native rule engine.

Includes functions for asserting a single letter alone, asserting a list of letters individually, asserting a string
of letters, generating an anagram rule dynamically, and ultimately one to take user input for a word with which to
generate all amagrans.

Call the generateAnagrams function (no arguments) to begin the UI for entering a word and to see all anagrams of that word printed out.
